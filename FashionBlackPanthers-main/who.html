        <h1>WHO WE ARE</h1>
        <p>
            You know the best part of the hard times? Is what makes us stronger. 
            Since the beginning, we have had to deal with hard times, and we deal with it the right way, as a family.  
            We stuck together through the storms we crossed by in the journey and our beloved admiral took over the helm, 
            Rosa Parks. She was there for us and we were there for her, and our ship has continued to navigate these 
            treacherous waters since 2000.<br>
            We’ve been transforming over and over, and we know we’ll keep transforming and this is our strength, 
            the ability to adapt and evolve with the difficulties imposed by hard times. Resilience is the key 
            word here in Black Panther, and love for eachother and for the people around us. We try to keep these 
            two principles in our daily routines, like a family living in a great neighborhood, we always try to 
            develop symbiotic relationships with our business partners, and that’s the secret spice of our intense 
            flavor which is what keeps making clients come back, cause we do it with love.<br>
            The mission was the same since the beginning a long time ago. Our looks are made by women to women, 
            and we care about our customers to really help them feel beautiful, shiny, radiant, powerful, able to 
            solve all the problems that sexist society throws at its back. The message is simple: “Resilience!” the 
            keyword for a woman in nowadays life, then we will be the oasis in the desert for them to rest, a 
            safeplace for them to go and be with other powerful woman that will help them get better, 
            feel beautier, increase their self-confidence, and just say to them that we care about them, 
            something like “hey, you matter, keep going!”.<br><br>
            Our effort in the sense of bringing responsible sources, encouraging the constant evolution of our 
            suppliers, comes from the idea of family. We take care of each other instead of replacing suppliers, 
            so we can increase cash flow from businesses that make a real difference in people's lives.
